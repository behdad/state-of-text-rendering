<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
Text is the primary means of communication in computers, and is bound to
be so for the decades to come.  With the widespread adoption of
<a href="http://www.unicode.org/">Unicode</a> as the canonical character
set for representing text a whole new domain has been opened up in a
desktop system software design.  Gone are the days that one would need to
input, render, print, search, spell-check, ... one language at a time.
The whole concept of internationalization (i18n) on which Unicode is based
is <q>all languages, all the time</q>.
</p>

<p>
The Free Software desktop has been rather late to the Unicode bandwagon, but
in the past ten years all the major pieces have gathered together and nowadays,
on a modern GNU/Linux distribution like Fedora, one cannot easily get anything
other than Unicode working.
</p>

<p>
Internationalization and Unicode text processing are about more than just
rendering text on the screen.  However, in this paper we focus on the specific
problem of text rendering, ie. from input Unicode text to pixels lit on the
screen.  We will discuss the current architecture, identify problems that have
limited progress in recent years, and propose actions to be taken to remedy
them.
</p>

<p>
While
there are multiple text rendering stacks available in the Free Software world
and even on a single GNU/Linux desktop, in this document we focus on the GNOME
text rendering stack and the Fedora Project where it comes to distro-specific
issues.  Fedora and Red Hat have been showing leadership in advancing the text
stack for years, and other distributions have been fast adopting these new
technology.  We expect that to remain the case for the years to come, although
it would be nice to see other distributions / communities start contributing
more closely to the parts of the stack we all share.
</p>

<p>
This document is a draft working-copy paper.  It is a roadmap of where we are
now and where we want to be, and will be updated as we get there.
</p>


<h2>Status Quo</h2>

When we talk about the text rendering stack, we really mean a collection of
separate modules sitting on top of each other:

<dl>

<dt>FreeType</dt>
<dd>
Performs font rasterization.  Given font data (file or data in memory), it
does simple (non-complex) mapping of Unicode characters to glyph indices and
rendering glyphs to images.
</dd>

<dt>Fontconfig</dt>
<dd>
Performs font selection based on a <em>pattern</em> of desired font
characteristics.  These characteristics typically include a family name,
style, weight, slant, size, as well as language.  Font configuration happens
by way of a set of very expressive XML rules.
Fontconfig uses FreeType to inspect fonts and caches the results in an
mmap()able architecture-specific binary cache.
</dd>

<dt>FriBidi</dt>
<dd>
GNU FriBidi is an implementation of the
<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/">Unicode
Bidirectional Algorithm</a>.  Pango uses FriBidi and has an internal
copy of it.  AbiWord is the other major user of FriBidi.  Many other
projects use FriBidi as the simplest route to add support for Hebrew
and Arabic scripts without adding support for a full complex text
rendering engine.
</dd>

<dt>HarfBuzz</dt>
<dd>
HarfBuzz is the meat in the modern GNU/Linux text rendering stack.  With
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/">OpenType</a>
emerging as the universal font format supporting complex text rendering,
HarfBuzz, as an OpenType Layout engine, is where all the magic happens.
In fact it is of such importance to the stack that it deserves an entire
section of its own in this document.
</dd>

<dt>Pango</dt>
<dd>
Pango is, for the most part, the roof of the text rendering stack.  Components
sitting on top of Pango (eg. GTK+) need not know about complexities of i18n
text and are expected to simply use these opaque objects called PangoLayout's.
Pango has been designed to satisfy GTK+'s needs for i18n text.
However, Pango still provides a low-level API on which one can build their
own layout engine.  This is what Firefox, Webkit-GTK, etc do, but it has
proved to be a cumbersome practice.  We will expand on that later.
</dd>

</dl>

There are other modules that are not immediately relevant to text rendering
but facilitate getting the text on the screen:

<h3>HarfBuzz</h3>

<p>
Traditionally fonts were a collection of glyphs and a simple one-to-one
mapping between characters and glyphs.  Rudimentary support for simple
ligatures was available in some font formats.  With Unicode however there
was a need for formats allowing complex transformation of glyphs (substitution
and positioning).  Two technologies were developed to achieve that, one is
OpenType Layout from Microsoft and Adobe, the other is AAT from Apple.
These two technologies, plus TrueType and Type1 font formats, all were
combined in what is called OpenType.
</p>
<p>
There are fundamental differences in how AAT and OpenType Layout work.
In AAT the font contains all the logic required to perform complex text
<em>shaping</em> (the process of converting Unicode text to glyph indices
and positions).  Whereas in OpenType, the script-specific logic (say, Arabic
cursive joining, etc) is part of the standard and implemented by the layout
engine, with fonts providing only the font-specific data that the layout
engine can use to perform complex shaping.
</p>
<p>
The Free Software text stack is based on the OpenType Layout technology.
<a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/HarfBuzz">HarfBuzz</a>
is an implementation of the OpenType Layout engine (aka layout engine)
and the script-specific logic (aka shaping engine).
</p>

<h4>History</h4>

<p>
Originally the FreeType project implemented the OpenType Layout engine
as part of the FreeType 2 project, however it was dropped from FreeType
at the last moment when it was decided that OpenType shaping is not
involved in rasterizing glyphs and hence is out of the scope of FreeType.
The FreeType Layout (FTL) code was salvaged by Pango and Qt developers
and kept in house for quite a few years.  Owen Taylor developed an
abstract buffer on top of the layout engine making it much easier to use.
</p>
<p>
Around 2006 (XXX) Pango and Qt developers cooperated to reunify the layout
engine again, and HarfBuzz was born as a freedesktop.org project.
</p>
<p>
In 2007 (XXX) TrollTech donated the Qt shapers to HarfBuzz under the same
license as the layout engine code.  This is the current state of HarfBuzz.
At this time Qt ships with its own copy of HarfBuzz which is identical to
the upstream HarfBuzz.  Pango ships with its own copy also, but only uses
the layout engine, and not the HarfBuzz shapers.

<h2>Consumers</h2>

<p>
One can loosely divide the consumers of the text rendering stack based on
their varying demands and requirements:
</p>

<ul>

<li><p>
<strong>GUI Toolkits</strong>
like GTK+ and Qt need the least flexibility when it comes
to text rendering.  Indeed, all the user cares about is that the text is
rendered to the screen and is legible.  Pango has been
specifically designed with this use case in mind.  Qt is even worse in that it
pretty much does not support any other use case.
Ultimately most (all?) other use cases should be made to use HarfBuzz directly,
freeing Pango to do what it's really good at: Providing an easy-to-use API for
GUI toolkits.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<strong>Web browsers</strong>
have two unique requirements that make it hard to use the native text stack
in full:
<ol>
<li>They have to abide by the very strict CSS font selection rules (as opposed
to, say, fontconfig's),</li>
<li>They need to support <em>web fonts</em>, that is, fonts that are not
installed on the system and are downloaded from the web on demand.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
It is worthwhile to review what the various web browser engines currently
use for their complex text support:
<ul>
<li><p>
<strong>Firefox</strong> uses Pango.  Firefox 2 was hacked to use
PangoLayout API. That was very abusive and inherently inefficient.  Firefox 3
has got a new layout engine that is completely based on cairo.  The Linux
port subclasses PangoFcFontMap to be able to support both CSS text selection
as well as web fonts.  By doing that it is essentially reimplementing most
of Pango and only using the shaping logic.  It makes much more sense to use
HarfBuzz directly, and Mozilla has expressed interest in doing that already.
They are awaiting HarfBuzz to be "ready" though TODO.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<strong>Webkit-GTK</strong> uses PangoCairo.  They use Pango the same way that
Firefox 2 used to do.  At the end of the day, it's at best a hack.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<strong>Webkit/Android</strong> is the webkit engine as used by Google in
Android and Chromium.  It uses a system called Skia for 2D graphics rendering.
The team at Google is working on a Linux port of Chromium and is working on
using HarfBuzz directly.

</ul>


<h2>The Problem</h2>

Over the past few years the Free Software text stack has made a lot of
progress.  When one looks at each piece, technical excellence is evident.
For example:
<ul>

<li><p>
FreeType has the widest range of supported font formats in the world.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Fontconfig has the most expressive font configuration language.  In fact,
other text rendering stacks simply don't have much of a configuration
mechanism.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Fontconfig-based text stacks have been the first to support font fallback
based on glyph coverage transparently.  This feature appeared in Mozilla
around the same time (early 2000s) and only recently in Windows Vista.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Pango has been the first text stack to support some of the minority scripts
encoded in Unicode, even before that version of Unicode was released.
</p></li>

<li><p>
FriBidi has been the most standard-complying implementation of the Unicode
Bidirectional Algorithm for years.  All algorithm bugs found in
FriBidi over the years have revealed bugs in the spec itself as well as its
reference implementations.
</p></li>

</ul>
</p><p>
However, when one stands back and look at the stack as a whole, it is not
something to envy.  As a whole, we have not been making ground-breaking
progress for quite a while.  The last major progress was the move to
client-side fonts itself which enabled a revolution.  Since then, it has
mostly been bug fixing, cleanup, polish, small features here and there.
Pretty similar to the GNOME2 status one would say.  Indeed, the client-side
fonts were first introduced in early GNOME2.  What we need is the GNOME3 of
text rendering, in time for GNOME3.
</p><p>
To those familiar with the text stack, it is hard to not see what is
wrong.  I believe there are two problems: 1) the current stack is
<em>good enough</em>, so improving it stays low-priority for parties involved,
and 2) what I like to call <em>segregated efforts</em>.  By that I mean,
for example:
<ul>

<li><p>
Fontconfig exposes a dangerously expressive configuration language in XML,
and from there any misconfiguration is <em>font packager</em>'s fault and not
fontconfig's.  Even if it is painfully hard to express sane preferences using
fontconfig rules.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Fontconfig rightly chose XML as its configuration language, the idea
being that font configuration GUIs can be developed to output configuration
XML based on user preferences.  This has yet to be realized.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Pango maintainer adds new features, making it possible to implement
advanced features in more demanding applications like designer tools,
but leaves it to others to actually implement such features in the tools
higher in the stack.  All the new features get is a mention in the release
notes and, if lucky, a blog post.
</p></li>

<li>Text Layout Summit TODO</li>

<li>unifont.org TODO</li>

<li>SIL Graphite TODO</li>

<li>m17n TODO</li>

<li>Linux Foundation Printing Summit / Working Group</li>

<li>TODO other examples</li>

</ul>
</p>

<p>
Only recently have the Desktop Team at Red Hat and the
Fedora Font SIG started working on features that extend across the stack
(vertically or horizontally):
<ul>

<li><p>
Online font addition/removal TODO
</p></li>

<li><p>
Automatic font installation TODO
</p></li>

<li><p>
Streamlining font packaging TODO
</p></li>

</ul>
</p>

Modern GNU/Linux desktops have become very complex systems.  With technologies
like D-BUS, PolicyKit, PackageKit and others spanning across the entire
desktop, integration becomes a much harder problem, and the secret ingredient
of a polished user experience.  It remain our challenge to provide that
experience when it becomes to i18n and text rendering.


<h3>Customer-facing Issues</h3>

While it is easy to understand the problems identified above, it may be hard
to justify working on fixing them from a business point of view.  However, the
following customer-facing issues can all be tracked down to the mentioned
problems:

<h4>CJK Problem</h4>
<p>
<em>CJK problem</em>
is an artifact of the
<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_unification">Unicode Han
Unification</a></em>.  That is, the fact
that the same Unicode character is used for all three of Traditional Chinese
(used in mainland China), Simplified Chinese (used in Hong Kong), and
Japanese.  The three languages, while sharing the same ideographs, require
different visual rendering of the shared characters, making correct font
selection critical for legible rendering of text in this family of languages.
</p><p>
Moreover, users of
these languages typically have different requirements for rendering Latin than
the rest of the world.  For example, while Indic or Arabic users prefer their
Latin text to be rendered using the default Latin font on the system, CJK
users want the Latin to be rendered using the same font used for CJK.  This is
because CJK characters are very complex drawings and <strong>must</strong> be
rendered using handcrafted bitmaps to be legible at small sizes.  Such bitmap
glyphs simply look ugly adjacent to antialiased Latin glyphs.
</p><p>
Inherent to the CJK problem is also communication failure.  CJK is a huge
and still emerging market, affecting over one billion of the world's population.
Yet it is hard to find two native field experts that can agree on the very
basics of how the fonts should look on screen.  So far the burden has been
falling on fontconfig and Fedora Font SIG maintainers to explore possible
solutions and implement them.  But we are not there yet.
To fix this problem, we need to go back to the design stage and re-design
how fontconfig configuration is supposed to work.  Extensions need to be added
to fontconfig's configuration idioms and the new idioms documented and
implemented across all font packages.
</p><p>
<strong>ACTION:</strong> Understand and document the roots of the problem,
extend fontconfig and Pango as necessary to be able to address the problem,
document idioms for font configuration in Fedora, and update all font packages
to use the new guidelines.

<h2>Road Ahead</h2>

<h3>Technical Issues</h3>

<p>
Experience shows that if module X needs to use library Y, it would make for
much better code if Y developers implement that in X and submit the patch to
X maintainers for review, than the common practice of X developers
implementing Y support in X based on available documentation
(which is always incomplete anyway).
With that in mind, we as the text stack maintainers need to reach
out upward to applications across the desktop whenever we add new features.
For example, if a new font selector and dialog are designed for GTK+, we need
to cooperate with OpenOffice.org, The GIMP, etc to make them provide users
with the same enhanced experience.
</p><p>
In this section we will identify areas that need technical attention to
advance the user experience with text rendering on the desktop:

<ul>

<li>HarfBuzz layout engine rewrite: 50% TODO</li>

<li>HarfBuzz shaper API redesign + merge with Pango TODO</li>

<li>Subpixel text rendering and positioning:
cairo, pango, gnome appearance capplet TODO
</li>

<li>Font selector and dialog: GTK+, OpenOffice.org, The GIMP, etc TODO</li>
<li>Desktop-wide font configuration GUI: font grouping, per font rendering
options, etc.  Closely related to font dialog TODO</li>

<li>Font websites: unifont.org, openfontlibrary, PackageKit, Fedora TODO</li>

<li>Font viewers: fontmatrix, gnome-font-viewer, gucharmap TODO</li>

<li>Application font support: Pango, librsvg, Inkscape, poppler, swfdec TODO</li>

</ul>

</p><p>
There are also issues that do not directly affect text rendering in the
context discussed so far, but are closely relevant and require some of the
same expertise to address:
<ul>
<li>Evince a11y TODO</li>
<li>PDF improvements: pango, cairo, poppler TODO</li>
<li>Poppler cairo backend improvements (user fonts, etc) TODO</li>
<li>Ghostscript cairo backend TODO</li>
</ul>
