<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

<p>
At the time of writing the initial version of this paper, the author was working
for Red Hat's Desktop team and has been involved with GNOME and Fedora for a
long time.  He has been a developer and/or maintainer of many
modules discussed in this paper at various times, including fribidi,
fontconfig, harfbuzz, pango, cairo, and gnome-terminal.
</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
Text is the primary means of communication in computers, and is bound to
be so for the decades to come.  With the widespread adoption of
<a href="http://www.unicode.org/">Unicode</a> as the canonical character
set for representing text a whole new domain has been opened up in a
desktop system software design.  Gone are the days that one would need to
input, render, print, search, spell-check, ... one language at a time.
The whole concept of internationalization (i18n) on which Unicode is based
is <q>all languages, all the time</q>.
</p>

<p>
The Free Software desktop has been rather late to the Unicode bandwagon, but
in the past ten years all the major pieces have gathered together and nowadays,
on a modern GNU/Linux distribution like Fedora, one cannot easily get anything
other than Unicode working.
</p>

<p>
Internationalization and Unicode text processing are about more than just
rendering text on the screen.  However, in this paper we focus on the specific
problem of text rendering, ie. from input Unicode text to pixels lit on the
screen.  We will discuss the current architecture, identify problems that have
limited progress in recent years, and propose actions to be taken to remedy
them.
</p>

<p>
While
there are multiple text rendering stacks available in the Free Software world
and even on a single GNU/Linux desktop, in this document we focus on the GNOME
text rendering stack and the Fedora Project where it comes to distro-specific
issues.  Fedora and Red Hat have been showing leadership in advancing the text
stack for years, and other distributions have been fast adopting these new
technologies.  We expect that to remain the case for the years to come,
although it would be nice to see other distributions / communities start
contributing more closely to the parts of the stack we all share.
</p>

<p>
This document is a draft working-copy paper.  It is a roadmap of where we are
now and where we want to be, and will be updated as we get there.
</p>


<h2>Status Quo</h2>

When we talk about the text rendering stack, we really mean a collection of
separate modules sitting on top of each other:

<dl>

<dt><a href="http://freetype.org/">FreeType</a></dt>
<dd>
Performs font rasterization.  Given font data (file or data in memory), it
does simple (non-complex) mapping of Unicode characters to glyph indices and
rendering glyphs to images.
</dd>

<dt><a href="http://fontconfig.org/">Fontconfig</a></dt>
<dd>
Performs font selection based on a <em>pattern</em> of desired font
characteristics.  These characteristics typically include a family name,
style, weight, slant, size, as well as language.  Font configuration happens
by way of a set of very expressive XML rules.
Fontconfig uses FreeType to inspect fonts and caches the results in an
mmap()able architecture-specific binary cache.
</dd>

<dt><a href="http://fribidi.org/">FriBidi</a></dt>
<dd>
GNU FriBidi is an implementation of the
<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/">Unicode
Bidirectional Algorithm</a>.  Pango uses FriBidi and has an internal
copy of it.  AbiWord is the other major user of FriBidi.  Many other
projects use FriBidi as the simplest route to add support for Hebrew
and Arabic scripts without adding support for a full complex text
rendering engine.
</dd>

<dt><a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/HarfBuzz">HarfBuzz</a></dt>
<dd>
HarfBuzz is the meat of the modern GNU/Linux text rendering stack.  With
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/">OpenType</a>
emerging as the universal font format supporting complex text rendering,
HarfBuzz, as an OpenType Layout engine, is where all the magic happens.
In fact it is of such importance to the stack that it deserves an entire
section of its own in this document.
</dd>

<dt><a href="http://pango.org/">Pango</a></dt>
<dd>
Pango is, for the most part, the roof of the text rendering stack.  Components
sitting on top of Pango (eg. GTK+) need not know about complexities of i18n
text and are expected to simply use these opaque objects called PangoLayout's.
Pango has been designed to satisfy GTK+'s needs for i18n text.
However, Pango still provides a low-level API on which one can build their
own layout engine.  This is what Firefox, Webkit-GTK, etc do, but it has
proved to be a cumbersome practice.  We will expand on that later.
</dd>

</dl>

There are other modules that are not immediately relevant to text rendering
but facilitate getting the text on the screen:
The X render extension provides the basic support for caching client-side
rendered glyph shapes in the X server and showing them on the screen.
Glyphs are rendered by the client (ie. application) and uploaded to the X
server which will then hash and only keep one copy of each image, but each
client has to go through the render+upload phase regardless.  There are
various higher-level wrappers around the text-rendering functionality of X
render: the old and semi-obsolete one being Xft.  These days however, cairo
does that job for the GNOME stack and Qt does it for KDE.


<h3>HarfBuzz</h3>

<p>
Traditionally fonts were a collection of glyphs and a simple one-to-one
mapping between characters and glyphs.  Rudimentary support for simple
ligatures was available in some font formats.  With Unicode however there
was a need for formats allowing complex transformation of glyphs (substitution
and positioning).  Two technologies were developed to achieve that, one is
OpenType Layout from Microsoft and Adobe, the other is AAT from Apple.
These two technologies, plus TrueType and Type1 font formats, all were
combined in what is called OpenType.
</p>
<p>
There are fundamental differences in how AAT and OpenType Layout work.
In AAT the font contains all the logic required to perform complex text
<em>shaping</em> (the process of converting Unicode text to glyph indices
and positions).  Whereas in OpenType, the script-specific logic (say, Arabic
cursive joining, etc) is part of the standard and implemented by the layout
engine, with fonts providing only the font-specific data that the layout
engine can use to perform complex shaping.
</p>
<p>
The Free Software text stack is based on the OpenType Layout technology.
<a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/HarfBuzz">HarfBuzz</a>
is an implementation of the OpenType Layout engine (aka layout engine)
and the script-specific logic (aka shaping engine).
</p>

<h4>History</h4>

<p>
Originally the FreeType project implemented the OpenType Layout engine
as part of the FreeType 2 project, however it was dropped from FreeType
at the last moment when it was decided that OpenType shaping is not
involved in rasterizing glyphs and hence is out of the scope of FreeType.
The FreeType Layout (FTL) code was salvaged by Pango and Qt developers
and kept in house for quite a few years.  Owen Taylor developed an
abstract buffer on top of the layout engine making it much easier to use.
</p>
<p>
Around 2006 Pango and Qt developers cooperated to reunify the layout
engine again, and HarfBuzz was born as a freedesktop.org project.
Initially it was just merging back the existing code and renaming it, but
after various meetings, the plan to make HarfBuzz be a unified shaping engine
was born and have been the goal since.  HarfBuzz was relicensed (thanks to
FreeType developers) to the old MIT license to rid it of the FTL advertisement
clause.
</p>
<p>
In 2007 (?) TrollTech donated the Qt shapers to HarfBuzz under the same
license as the layout engine code.  This is the current state of HarfBuzz.
At this time Qt ships with its own copy of HarfBuzz which is identical to
the upstream HarfBuzz.  Pango ships with its own copy also, but only uses
the layout engine, and not the HarfBuzz shapers.
</p>
<p>
Since 2008 the author has been working on rewriting the layout engine to
be more robust and use mmap()ed fonts efficiently, and that work is mostly
done now.  Next step is to design a user-friendly high-level API for the
shaping engine and merge the Pango and Qt shapers and put them under the new
API.  This is a work in progress by Red Hat and Mozilla.
</p>
<p>
HarfBuzz is currently being used by Pango, Qt, the Linux port of Google's
Chromium browser, as well as some smaller project.  The grand plan is for it
to be used directly by any code needing direct access to a portable and robust
complex shaping engine.  That would include toolkits, browsers, word
processors, and design applications.  We will expand on that in a later
section.
</p>


<h4>Other Free Software Shaping Engines</h4>
<dl>

<dt><a href="http://icu-project.org/">ICU</a></dt>
<dd>ICU is the Internationalization Classes for Unicode, a library developed
by IBM with existing ports in C, C++, and Java.  It does a lot more than
shaping, and is a huge library.  That's perhaps the main reason why it is not
used widely for shaping.  The most notable users of ICU are the OpenOffice.org
suite and Sun's Java implementation.  It is highly probable that ICU will be
ported to using HarfBuzz when HarfBuzz gets to production stage.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://www.m17n.org/index.html">m17n</a></dt>
<dd>Mostly of academic importance, m17n is an internationalization framework
that includes a shaping engine.  Its most notable characteristic is that it
is based on language- and script-specific shaping rules expressed as Lisp code.
Latest versions of Emacs use m17n for complex text rendering.
</dd>

<dt><a href="http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=RenderingGraphite">SIL Graphite</a></dt>
<dd>SIL Graphite is a complex/smart-font technology parallel to OpenType
Layout.  In this framework, the font itself contains all the shaping logic and
the engine has no language- or script-specific knowledge.  This allows for
developing fonts for minority scripts and languages without having to update
the engine first.  For established scripts though, there is not much reason to
prefer Graphite over OpenType.</dd>

</dl>


<h4>Consumers</h4>

<p>
One can loosely divide the consumers of the text rendering stack based on
their varying demands and requirements:
</p>

<ul>

<li><p>
<strong>GUI Toolkits</strong>
like GTK+ and Qt need the least flexibility when it comes
to text rendering.  Indeed, all the user cares about is that the text is
rendered to the screen and is legible.  Pango has been
specifically designed with this use case in mind.  Qt is even worse in that it
pretty much does not support any other use case.
Ultimately most (all?) other use cases should be made to use HarfBuzz directly,
freeing Pango to do what it's really good at: Providing an easy-to-use API for
GUI toolkits.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<strong>Web browsers</strong>
have two unique requirements that make it hard to use the native text stack
in full:
<ol>
<li>They have to abide by the very strict CSS font selection rules (as opposed
to, say, fontconfig's),</li>
<li>They need to support <em>web fonts</em>, that is, fonts that are not
installed on the system and are downloaded from the web on demand.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
It is worthwhile to review what the various web browser engines currently
use for their complex text support:
<ul>
<li><p>
<strong>Firefox</strong> uses Pango.  Firefox 2 was hacked to use
PangoLayout API. That was very abusive and inherently inefficient.  Firefox 3
has got a new layout engine that is completely based on cairo.  The Linux
port subclasses PangoFcFontMap to be able to support both CSS text selection
as well as web fonts.  By doing that it is essentially reimplementing most
of Pango and only using the shaping logic.  It makes much more sense to use
HarfBuzz directly, and Mozilla is now working on getting HarfBuzz ready for
that.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<strong>Webkit-GTK</strong> uses PangoCairo.  They use Pango the same way that
Firefox 2 used to do.  At the end of the day, it's at best a hack.  Moving
to HarfBuzz when the time is right should fix that.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<strong>Webkit/Android</strong> is the webkit engine as used by Google in
Android and Chromium.  It uses a system called Skia for 2D graphics rendering.
The team at Google has released an alpha Linux port of Chromium that is
using HarfBuzz directly.
</ul>
</p>
</li>

<li><p>
<strong>Word processors</strong>' biggest unique demand from a shaping engine
is good support for and lots of control on line hyphenation and justification.
Also important to them is choosing fonts as closely and robustly as possible
to the font requested by the document.  Device-independent metrics as well as
metric-compatibility with other word processors is another requirement
(required by all kinds of office suite applications really.)
OpenOffice.org currently uses ICU and AbiWord uses Pango.  Both will have a
better time using HarfBuzz shaping directly.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<strong>Designer tools</strong> demand much of what word processors do, but
also access to advanced font features (alternate glyphs, etc), being able to
correctly handle fonts with many various (and non-standard) styles,
things like manual kerning, as well using SVG fonts and embedded subsetted
fonts.
Inkscape and The GIMP use Pango currently, and Scribus is in transition to /
has been ported to using HarfBuzz directly.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<strong>Font designer tools</strong> can use HarfBuzz directly to generate
previews.  Other than that there is not much else to share really, even though
they both deal with the very same objects (fonts): the font tools needs to be
able to generate font tables, which is out of the scope of a shaping engine.
Fontforge has the option to use Pango currently.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<strong>Terminal emulators</strong> with support for complex text are very
weird hybrids.  On the one hand terminal emulators have to lay text out in a
predefined grid in a predefined way, which is in conflict with many aspects
and requirements of complex text, on the other hand users demand support for
complex text in their terminals.  It gets uglier when you think about
bidirectional text, say, inside a console text editor.
Nonetheless, it is fair to say that such hybrids do not put any new demands on
the shaping engine.
gnome-terminal currently has no support for complex text other than
combining marks.  Konsole has bidirectional text support.  Apple's Terminal App
has at least bidi support as well as Arabic shaping support, not sure about
other complex text.
<strong>Update (Jan 18, 2010):</strong>
The terminal mode (term and ansi-term) in recent versions of Emacs can render
complex text, including Indic.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<strong>Batch document processors</strong>  have no requirements other than
what's required by, say, browsers or word processors.  However, so far a
decent internationalized batch document processor has pretty much been
nonexistent.  The reason historically has been that shaping engines were
always developed in the context of GUI frameworks, and batch processors
typically do not rely on one, and hence are designed without the i18n models
present in all moderns GUIs in mind.
XMLFO / Docbook processors, etc fit in this category and should use HarfBuzz
and the rest of the stack for full complex text support.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<strong>TeX engines</strong> are batch document processors but worth looking
into separately.  Historically TeX had no shaping engines and basic shaping
was done using macro packages and a variety of hacks.  More recently though,
XeTeX was invented.  XeTeX simply outsources the shaping to an external
library, ICU or Apple's ATSUI currently.  XeTeX is a separate branch of the
TeX evolutionary hierarchy than the mainstream pdfTeX though.  The XeTeX
creator is working on HarfBuzz on behalf of Mozilla now, and plans to port
XeTeX to HarfBuzz eventually.  In the long term though, pdfTeX's successor
luaTeX should be made to do the same thing.  There is more to Unicode support
than just shaping, and in those areas the TeX engines can gain a lot by
building on top of existing libraries.
</p></li>

</ul>


<h2>The Problem</h2>

Over the past few years the Free Software text stack has made a lot of
progress.  When one looks at each piece, technical excellence is evident.
For example:
<ul>

<li><p>
FreeType has the widest range of supported font formats in the world.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Fontconfig has the most expressive font configuration language.  In fact,
other text rendering stacks simply don't have much of a configuration
mechanism.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Fontconfig-based text stacks have been the first to support font fallback
based on glyph coverage transparently.  This feature appeared in Mozilla
around the same time (early 2000s) and only recently in Windows Vista as
far as I know, though I've been pointed to <a
href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb688099?ppud=4">this</a>
which suggests that <i>per-script</i> font fallback was supported since
Windows 2000, but certainly not <i>per-codepoint</i>.
</p></li>

<li><p>
FriBidi has been the most standard-complying implementation of the Unicode
Bidirectional Algorithm for years.  All algorithm bugs found in
FriBidi over the years have revealed bugs in the spec itself as well as its
reference implementations.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Pango has been the first text stack to support some of the minority scripts
encoded in Unicode, even before that version of Unicode was officially released.
</p></li>

</ul>
</p><p>
However, when one stands back and looks at the stack as a whole, it is not
something to envy.  As a whole, we have not been making ground-breaking
progress for quite a while.  The last major progress was the move to
client-side fonts itself which fueled a renaissance.  Since then, it has
mostly been bug fixing, cleanup, polish, small features here and there.
Pretty similar to the GNOME2 status one would say.  Indeed, the client-side
fonts were first introduced in early GNOME2.  What we need is the GNOME3 of
text rendering, in time for GNOME3.
</p><p>
To those familiar with the text stack, it is hard to not see what is
wrong.  I believe there are two problems: 1) the current stack is
<em>good enough</em>, so improving it stays low-priority for parties involved,
and 2) what I like to call <em>segregated efforts</em>.  By that I mean,
for example:
<ul>

<li><p>
Fontconfig exposes a dangerously expressive configuration language in XML,
and from there any misconfiguration is <em>font packager</em>'s fault and not
fontconfig's.  Even if it is painfully hard to express sane preferences using
fontconfig rules.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Fontconfig rightly chose XML as its configuration language, the idea
being that font configuration GUIs can be developed to output configuration
XML based on user preferences.  This has yet to be realized though.
<strong>Update (Jan 18, 2010):</strong>
There is a small GUI project called
<a href="http://suruma.freeflux.net/blog/archive/2009/10/14/fontik-a-font-configuration-gui.html">Fontik</a>
that allows per-font configuration.  This is a step in the right direction
IMO.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Pango maintainer adds new features, making it possible to implement
advanced features in more demanding applications like designer tools,
but leaves it to others to actually implement such features in the tools
higher in the stack.  All the new features get is a mention in the release
notes and, if lucky, a blog post.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Text Layout Summit has been a fairly successful meeting bringing all
interested parties together since 2006 (it has been held at GNOME Boston
Summit 2006, Akademy 2007, and Libre Graphics Meeting 2008).  However, those
same parties do not work as closely out of the meeting.  For example, while
Scribus and HarfBuzz developers have been discussing various issues at length
during these meetings, there has not been a much email exchange between the
projects over the years.
</p></li>

<li><p>
unifont.org is a website that has many of the right aspirations for how an
ideal font and text ecosystem should look like, but the project does not work
with the HarfBuzz and other library designers as closely as I like to see.
</p></li>

<li><p>
SIL Graphite and m17n both are reinventing the wheel in one sense.  They each
definitely have their own justifications why a new wheel may be needed, but
the fact remains, that their efforts does not advance the mainstream GNU/Linux
text rendering pipeline.
</p></li>

</ul>
</p>

<p>
One may even argue that the extremely modular design of GNU/Linux systems
makes it painfully hard to expose a truly integrated solution, in many areas
including text rendering.  For example, the X architecture combined with
client-side font rendering makes it close to impossible to optimize the
pipeline to take advantage of all the possibilities exposed by modern GPUs,
like Microsoft does for example.  However, that excuse is irrelevant as it may
be part of the problem statement, but it hardly is the answer.
</p>

<h3>Recent Advances</h3>

<p>
Only recently have the Desktop Team at Red Hat and the
Fedora Font SIG started working on features that extend across the stack
(vertically or horizontally):
<ul>

<li><p>
<strong>Online font addition/removal:</strong>
The user-visible feature here is that when a new font is installed or an
existing one removed, running applications pick that up automatically and in a
matter of seconds, without needing a restart.  Implementing this feature
involved changes way higher in desktop stack, and surprisingly, no changes in
the text stack itself: the text stack already provided the API needed to build
this feature on top of it for years, but it was never used.
The changes required where in fact in GTK+ and
gnome-settings-daemon.  The way this works is:
<ol>
<li>gnome-settings-daemon gets the list of all relevant font files and
directories and uses glib/gio to monitor them for changes,</li>
<li>Upon noticing a change, it asks fontconfig to rebuild its cache,</li>
<li>When the new cache is ready, gnome-settings-daemon notifies all running
application using the XSETTINGS framework,</li>
<li>GTK+ catches the notification and asks Pango to drop all its caches,</li>
<li>GTK+ sends the application a "theme-changed" signal such that the
application windows are redrawn, using the new font database.</li>
</ol>
</p></li>

<li><p>
<strong>Automatic font installation:</strong>
Building on top of the previous feature, this feature involves automatic
detection of missing fonts, and installing them.  Minimal changes in the text
stack were required.  The main changes were in RPM and PackageKit.  The way
this works is:
<ol>
<li>When building packages, RPM detects fonts,</li>
<li>For each font, RPM uses fontconfig's new fc-query tool and
FcPatternFormat() to build a list of "Provides" tags for the list.
For example, the Deja Vu Sans font will
"provide" the tags "font(:lang=en)" as well as "font(dejavusans)" among
others,</li>
<li>packagekit-gnome installs a system-wide GTK+ module to be loaded by
all GTK+ applications,</li>
<li>The PackageKit GTK+ module overrides the default Pango fontmap such
that when a font is requested but not found, a message is send to the
PackageKit daemon,</li>
<li>Upon receiving such messages, the PackageKit daemon searches the package
database for the requested font tag, and shows a dialog asking user for
permission, and showing a list of font packages available that fulfill the
request,</li>
<li>When the new font is installed, running applications pick it up
automatically, no need to message them back.</li>
</ol>

</p></li>

<li><p>
<strong>Streamlining font packaging:</strong>
The Fedora Font SIG rightfully recognized that it is actually painfully hard
for font packagers to write the correct fontconfig configuration for their
font packages.  Indeed, no one really knows what the correct configuration
really is.  It also does not help that many font packagers want their font to
be used as the default font for their language.  So, during the past year the
SIG has been busy drafting the Fedora font packaging guidelines and getting
them passed officially.  A major font package cleanup followed.  This is still
a work in progress, but a step in the right direction on the distro level.
</p></li>

</ul>
</p>

Modern GNU/Linux desktops have become very complex systems.  With technologies
like D-BUS, PolicyKit, PackageKit and others spanning across the entire
desktop, integration becomes a much harder problem, and the secret ingredient
of a polished user experience.  It remain our challenge to provide that
experience when it becomes to i18n and text rendering.


<h3>User/Customer-facing Issues</h3>

While it is easy to understand the problems identified, it may be hard
to justify working on fixing them from a business point of view.  However, the
following user- and customer-facing issues can all be tracked down to the
mentioned problems:

<h4>CJK Problem</h4>
<p>
<em>CJK problem</em>
is an artifact of the
<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_unification">Unicode Han
Unification</a></em>.  That is, the fact
that the same Unicode character is used for all three of Traditional Chinese
(used Hong Kong and Taiwan), Simplified Chinese (used in mainland China), and
Japanese (a variation of Simplified Chinese originally).
The three languages, while sharing the same ideographs, require
different visual rendering of the shared characters, making correct font
selection critical for legible rendering of text in this family of languages.
</p><p>
Moreover, users of
these languages typically have different requirements for rendering Latin than
the rest of the world.  For example, while Indic or Arabic users prefer their
Latin text to be rendered using the default Latin font on the system, CJK
users want the Latin to be rendered using the same font used for CJK.  This is
because CJK characters are very complex drawings and <strong>must</strong> be
rendered using handcrafted bitmaps to be legible at small sizes.  Such bitmap
glyphs simply look ugly adjacent to antialiased Latin glyphs.
</p><p>
Inherent to the CJK problem is also communication failure.  CJK is a huge
and still emerging market, affecting over one billion of the world's population.
Yet it is hard to find two native field experts that can agree on the very
basics of how the fonts should look on screen.  So far the burden has been
falling on fontconfig and Fedora Font SIG maintainers to explore possible
solutions and implement them.  But we are not there yet.
To fix this problem, we need to go back to the design stage and re-design
how fontconfig configuration is supposed to work.
Fontconfig configuration idioms need to be extended and the new idioms
documented and implemented across all font packages.
</p><p>
<strong>ACTION:</strong> Understand and document the roots of the problem,
extend fontconfig and Pango as necessary to be able to address the problem,
document idioms for font configuration in Fedora, and update all font packages
to use the new guidelines.
<br/>
<strong>STATUS:</strong> Behdad to read <a
href="http://www.amazon.ca/CJKV-Information-Processing-Ken-Lunde/dp/0596514476/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1239040764&sr=8-1">CJKV
Information Processing, 2nd edition</a>.
</p>


<h4>Indic Problem</h4>
<p>
<em>Indic problem</em> is rooted in the fact that over a dozen of scripts used
in India are all implemented using a single shaper driven by different
data-tables.  This makes a lot of sense from a design point of view since the
scripts are very similar in the way they are encoded in Unicode.  However,
each of them does have delicate differences in how certain common characters
interact with the others and that has made it hard to fix bugs in one script
without breaking others.  The Indic shapers in both Pango and Qt were ported
from the one in ICU, so this problem is common to all available free-software
Indic shapers.  It is practically impossible to fix the tens of outstanding
Indic bugs without first merging all the available implementation and also
developing an exhaustive test suite.
</p><p>
Moreover, the Open Type Indic standard was also so complex and
hard to implement correctly that Microsoft moved to a new Indic standard in
Vista.  There is currently no free implementation available for the new
standard.
</p><p>
<strong>ACTION:</strong>
Merge the three Indic shapers into one as part of the HarfBuzz shaper
merger with Pango.
<strong>STATUS:</strong>
Jonathan Kew of Mozilla will do this as soon as the new shaping infrastructure
in HarfBuzz is in place.
</p><p>
<strong>ACTION:</strong>
Develop an extensive Indic shaping test suite,
as part of a larger, HarfBuzz-wide, shaping test suite.
<strong>STATUS:</strong>
A high priority item after the basic new shaping infrastructure in HarfBuzz is
in place.
</p><p>
<strong>ACTION:</strong>
Develop an Indic shaper for the new OpenType Indic standard.
<br/>

<h4>Latin Problem</h4>
<em>Latin problem</em> is not really inherent to Latin, but it refers to the
problem that currently it is hard or impossible to use high-quality, usually
very expensive, fonts that have many different styles.  This is not a high
priority issue for using the desktop for day to day purposes, but is a real
showstopper for graphic design applications as well as word processors.
This is mostly a Pango limitation.
</p><p>
<strong>ACTION:</strong>
Understand the scope of the problem and design a solution in Pango.
<br/>
<strong>STATUS:</strong>
Behdad to work on the understanding part this week.

<h2>Road Ahead</h2>

<p>
Experience shows that if module X needs to use library Y, it would make for
much better code if Y developers implement that in X and submit the patch to
X maintainers for review, than the common practice of X developers
implementing Y support in X based on available documentation
(which is always incomplete anyway).
With that in mind, we as the text stack maintainers need to reach
out upward to applications across the desktop whenever we add new features.
For example, if a new font selector and dialog are designed for GTK+, we need
to cooperate with OpenOffice.org, The GIMP, etc to make them provide users
with the same enhanced experience.
</p><p>
In this section we will identify areas that can benefit from immediate
technical attention to advance the user experience with text rendering on the
free desktop.  We also need to start thinking about more integration issue and
seek longer term vision for improving the text rendering experience.

<ul>

<li>HarfBuzz layout engine rewrite: 90% done.  The code currently lives in
Pango's harfbuzz-ng branch.  Needs to be tested for portability to various
platforms and toolchains.</li>

<li>HarfBuzz shaper API redesign: Work started by Behdad and Jonathan Kew.
Expecting drafts in August, and finalized early next year.</li>

<li>Merge HarfBuzz shapers with Pango and port to new framework:
Jonathan Kew to work on it after the API draft is out.</li>

<li>Subpixel text rendering and positioning:
Fix subpixel issues and implement subpixel positioning API in
cairo, and revamp gnome appearance applet to reflect this.
</li>

<li>Font selector and dialog: Design a better, more usable, font chooser
dialog with internationalized font preview in GTK+, OpenOffice.org, The GIMP
</li>

<li>Desktop-wide font configuration GUI: Should support font grouping,
per font rendering options, etc.  Closely related to font dialog.
Fontmatrix may be a good start.</li>

<li>Font websites: Integrate the next version of OpenFontLibrary being
currently worked on with PackageKit and distros for a unified font discovery
and installation.</li>

<li>Font viewers: Design a better font viewer.  Fontmatrix is, again, a good
start, but may make sense to unify this with the Character Map application.
</li>

<li>Application font support in Pango, then use that feature in librsvg,
Inkscape, poppler, swfdec, etc.</li>

</ul>

</p><p>
There are also issues that do not directly affect text rendering in the
context discussed so far, but are closely relevant and require some of the
same expertise to address:
<ul>
<li>Evince/PDF accessibility support</li>
<li>PDF text extraction improvements: cairo, pango, poppler</li>
<li>Poppler cairo backend improvements (user fonts, etc)</li>
<li>Functional Ghostscript cairo backend</li>
</ul>
